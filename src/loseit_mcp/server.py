"""MCP tool definitions for Lose It!.

The same tool set serves two deployment shapes:

- **Single-tenant** (default, and the only sane shape for stdio): one account,
  configured from the environment. Every request uses the same service.
- **Multi-tenant**: credentials arrive per request as headers and sessions are
  cached, so one hosted server can serve many accounts. See
  :mod:`loseit_mcp.tenancy`.

Tools take a ``Context`` so they can read request headers in multi-tenant mode;
the MCP runtime injects it and keeps it out of the tool's input schema.

Read and write the user's Lose It! food diary.

Logging a meal:
1. `search_food` returns candidates with nutrition. Entries are user-submitted
   and often wrong, so compare them rather than taking the first: a sound entry
   has protein*4 + carb*4 + fat*9 near its calories, and values that recur
   across duplicates are the trustworthy ones.
2. `log_food` with the chosen `food_id`, a meal, and a portion.

Prefer parts over wholes: a Chipotle bowl is chicken + rice + beans + sour
cream, each searched and logged separately.

Portions: `serving_amount` + `serving_unit` (e.g. 120 + "g") for a concrete
quantity, else `servings` as a multiplier of the serving shown in the search
result. One or the other, never both. `dry_run=true` previews the math.

`log_custom_food` is a last resort, after searching for both the dish and its
parts.

Deleting: `get_diary` for an `entry_id`, then `delete_entry`.
